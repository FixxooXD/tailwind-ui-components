# Tailwind UI Components

Tailwind UI Components are ready made tailwind css boilerplates that can be used in your project out of the box. Our goal with this project is to provide fundamental ui components that can be the building block for more complex ui components or templates.

Imagine you are starting a new project from scratch and you need a button and some variants (primary, secondary, disabled, hovered state) for that button. Now you can do that yourself using tailwind but it will take some time, isn't it ?

Now guess what :innocent: we just aim to eliminate that time to build each and evety components from scratch. We are trying to build some handy components with theming in mind, so that you can just copy paste the boilerplate and get the job done in seconds!

## How to use ?

1. Setup Tailwind CSS ([installation guide][tailwind-docs]).
2. Choose any component from available [components][components].
3. Choose any theme between the light and the dark.
4. Click the HTML or JSX buttons to see the code for the respective framework.
5. Copy and paste the code into your project.
6. See the code in action.
